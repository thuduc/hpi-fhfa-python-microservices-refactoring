# RSAI Microservices Architecture

## Overview
Microservices implementation of the Repeat-Sales Aggregation Index (RSAI) model, refactored from the original monolithic Python application.

## Architecture
This system is composed of 8 microservices that work together to process real estate transaction data and generate house price indices:

### Core Services
1. **API Gateway** (`:8000`) - Request routing and authentication
2. **Data Ingestion Service** (`:8001`) - Data loading and preprocessing  
3. **Data Validation Service** (`:8002`) - Data quality assessment
4. **Geography Service** (`:8003`) - Spatial data processing and supertract generation
5. **Index Calculation Service** (`:8004`) - BMN regression and index computation
6. **Export Service** (`:8005`) - Data export and visualization
7. **Orchestration Service** (`:8006`) - Workflow management
8. **Configuration Service** (`:8007`) - Centralized configuration

### Shared Components
- **Shared Models** - Common data models and schemas
- **Common Utilities** - Logging, monitoring, database utilities

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.12)
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy, statsmodels
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, PostGIS, TimescaleDB, Redis
- **Message Queue**: Redis Streams
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-asyncio

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/thuduc/hpi-fhfa-python-microservices-refactoring.git
cd hpi-fhfa-python-microservices-refactoring

# Start infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Install dependencies for each service
cd services/data-ingestion
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run individual service
python -m app.main

# Or run all services
docker-compose up
```

### API Documentation
Once running, visit:
- API Gateway: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Individual service docs at their respective ports

## Service Communication
Services communicate via:
- **REST APIs** for synchronous operations
- **Redis Streams** for asynchronous data flow
- **PostgreSQL** for shared data persistence

## Data Flow
```
Raw Data → Ingestion → Validation → Geography → Index Calculation → Export
           ↓            ↓           ↓           ↓                 ↓
         Events       Events    Events     Events           Events
```

## Development

### Adding a New Service
1. Create service directory in `services/`
2. Copy template structure from existing service
3. Update Docker Compose configuration
4. Add service to API Gateway routing

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run service-specific tests  
cd services/data-ingestion
pytest tests/

# Integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
black .

# Type checking  
mypy .

# Linting
flake8 .
```

## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Production
```bash
# Build production images
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

# Deploy
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint on each service
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`
- **Logs**: Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs

## Migration from Monolith
This microservices implementation maintains full compatibility with the original RSAI mathematical models while providing improved scalability and maintainability. See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed migration instructions.

## PoC Assessment

**Development Velocity**: This microservices architecture was refactored and built in hours, not months. What traditionally takes a team weeks to develop - complete with service decomposition, API gateway setup, inter-service communication patterns, Docker containerization, and database orchestration - was delivered as production-ready code in a single session. The system transforms a monolithic RSAI implementation into 8 loosely-coupled services with proper event-driven architecture.

**LLM Capabilities**: Claude Code and Claude 4 LLMs can get us 90-95% of the way to production-ready microservices architectures, handling complex distributed system patterns, FastAPI service implementations, Docker Compose orchestration, and shared data model designs that would typically require expertise across software architecture, DevOps, and distributed systems engineering.

**Production Readiness Gap**: The remaining 5-10% involves fine-tuning service boundaries based on actual load patterns, implementing comprehensive observability and tracing across services, establishing proper secrets management and service mesh security, and optimizing database sharding strategies for high-volume real estate data processing - tasks that require operational experience but benefit significantly from the AI-generated microservices foundation.
